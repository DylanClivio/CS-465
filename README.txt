Architecture:
I used HTML and JavaScript with Express for server-rendered pages.
Server-side rendering with Express HTML and JavaScript provided faster initial loads for users.
I also implemented a single-page application (SPA) using Angular, which offered a smoother and more interactive user experience.
The backend used MongoDB because it is flexible and provides efficiency for handling evolving data.
Using a NoSQL database allowed for faster, simpler storage and querying of JSON data.

Functionality:
JSON is a language-independent data format and JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for client-side scripting.
JSON serves as a structured medium for data exchange which enables smooth communication between the frontend and backend of the application.

Testing:
API testing involved testing GET and POST requests to ensure proper data handling and retrieval when creating, editing, or updating trip records.
Authentication required integrating tokens and access controls to completely secure any user logins.
Testing also focused on request validation and preventing any unauthorized access.

Reflection:
This course has expanded my understanding of full-stack development, making me a more well-rounded developer.
Whether working on exclusively the frontend or exclusively backend, knowing how everything comes together provides better overall comprehension.
I gained a deeper understanding of backend APIs, frontend frameworks, and MongoDB. While I had previous experience with a few things, the utilization of MongoDB was particularly eye-opening in this context that focused on a user-oriented design.
